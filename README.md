## How it works

* CALLO helps manage users' daily caloric intake by allowing users to choose how many total calories they'd like to consume in a day and how many meals they'd like to have.

* CALLO will do a quick calculation and divvy up the number calories among the number of meal chose. Users can then navigate to each meal and pick which foods they'd like to have.

* CALLO will help the user find foods that they want to eat while staying within the calorie limit they have set.
