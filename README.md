## How it works

* CALLO helps manage users' daily caloric intake by allowing users to choose how many total calories they'd like to consume in a day and how many meals they'd like to have.

* CALLO will do a quick calculation and divvy up the number calories among the number of meal chose. Users can then navigate to each meal and pick which foods they'd like to have.

* CALLO will help the user find foods that they want to eat while staying within the calorie limit they have set.


## Example

* After a user sets their number of calories for the day and the number of meals they want, they can go into each meal and pick foods that are within their caloric limit.
